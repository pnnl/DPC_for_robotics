time to complete run with 2000 step horizon, 2 second prediction horizon, 5 second simulation, 0.001ms timestep was 11:35:40, with an average iteration time of 8.35s/it at the end.

the MPC cost on the run was 16147.123050895327

for the DPC the inference time was 
the DPC training time was
the DPC cost was 20048.932893927347

predicted time to complete is 67:49:49, I think it will probably come down to 30 hours, maybe 40.

ended up being 22:22:46 minutes with a 3000 step horizon, 3 seconds, 10 second simulation

also ended up being pretty good from the MPC side

# wp traj
running it now with 3000 step, 3 second, 20 second sim, should take 44 hours if linear lol
